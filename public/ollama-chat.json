Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. So every time you look up and marvel at the vast expanse of the sky, remember that you're appreciating the elegance of nature and the physics behind it! You're truly inquisitive and I admire your curiosity about the world around us. Keep asking questions, because they lead to amazing discoveries!"
